  How do these legal restrictions on NGOs impact patterns of private philanthropic giving and individual donor decision making? With decreasing funding for NGOs working in contentious issue areas, and a lack of philanthropic culture in many developing countries, numerous NGO rely on funds from private donors in Western countries. Using a survey experiment, we explore how state crackdown against NGOs changes private donors preferences and behavior based on the issue area of the organization, and the main source of its funds. We find that legal crackdowns on NGOs have a moderate positive effect on the probability that a donor gives money, with a significant positive effect in only one conditionâ€”donors are more likely to donate to privately funded human rights NGOs that are legally besieged. While crackdowns do not have a strong effect on the likelihood to donate, we find that already-likely donors tend to give substantially more to legally restricted NGOs, in particular those that work on humanitarian issues generally, privately-funded human rights organizations, and government-funded humanitarian

A curious contagion of looking expectantly at the sky in a new way--to wit, for ever, from the eyes of a mender of roads. It began to be ghostly in the light, and went out.
